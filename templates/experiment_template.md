# Metadata ("YAML header" aka "YAML Front Matter", YFM)
# Note: Variable names are converted to lower-case.
# `Template`: Specify a Template to use to display this page (default: `index`). Templates must be located in the current theme's directory as `template_name.twig`.
# `title`: People have different preferences for title format, so we need to have expid and titledesc explicitly as well.
# `expid`: Unique experiment identification number or string. Often initials plus a three-digit number, e.g. `RS023`.
# `titledesc`: A very short description of the experiment, often just `title` without `expid`.
# `description`: A slightly longer description; recognized by Pico).
# `motivation`, `goal`, `hypothesis`: Write these BEFORE you start the experiment.
# `outline`: A brief outline of the steps/parts performed in this experiment in order to produce the end product, possibly including the starting point if not mentioned under `motivation`.
# `result`, `outlook`: Write these AFTER you've completed the experiment.
# `comments`: Other comments about the experiment not matching either of goal/hypothesis/result/outlook.
# `summary_image`: Can be used to specify a single "thumbnail" that will be used to visually represent this experiment in a long overview.
# `status`: planned, started, completed, or cancelled.
# `startdate`, `enddate`, `date`: start and end dates for the experiment (when actually started, else null). Date can be the day *this file* was created.
# `author`: A single, primary author of this document; recognized by Pico
# `authors`: List everyone who co-authored *this* document.
# `collaborators`: List everyone involved with the experiment (even if they didn't contribute to this document).
# `projects`, `related_expids`, `related_pages`: List projects, related experiments (by ID), and other internal ELN pages related to this experiment.
# `links`: Links (URLs) to standard, named resources, e.g. labbook, webstrate, etc.
# For now, other ad-hoc references are added using standard Markdown named-references: A line with [arbitrary case-insensitive reference key]: https://myreference-url.org

<!-- End YAML Front Matter (page metadata), begin actual Markdown page. -->
<!--

Usage:

* First, fill in the YAML metadata above. These are simple `key: value` pairs.
* The "new expriment" markdown template has {{variable}} placeholders, which are replaced with actual values when creating the page (using "Create New Experiment" command).
	* Note: If you are editing the input template file, you will see "{{variable}}" above surrounded by two braces because we don't want to substitute "variable". After variable substitution, it will have just a *single* brace and look "right" in the newly created page.)
* You can use %meta.variable% as placeholder to insert meta data on page for Pico page rendering.
* You can use the `Template` metadata field to specify a template on a per-page basis.
* Pico recognizes and uses the following page meta headers: `title`, `description`, `author`, `date`, `robots`
* Pico additionally provides these derived variables: `id`, `url`, `time`, `date_formatted`, `raw_content`. - `date_formatted` is a string produced from the datetime given the configured date display format.


Extended description of metadata fields:

* `Title` is the full experiment title, including expid and possibly other identifies (e.g. start date). People may have different preferences for title format. Title should not be entered manually; it is generated by a format string using other variables.
* `Titledesc` is a short "title description" of the experiment, without any identifiers.


Nomenclature and naming conventions:

* Current titledesc format is "<project/subproject keyword> + <sample keyword> + <process/method/technique>", with title = exp + titledesc.
	* Note the order: Sample keyword first, then process/method/technique. Special setting/locality/occation can also be added.
	* Exp title examples: "RS505 Bacteriophage TEM", "RS522 OMX 20nmGrid PAINT".
* For exp parts/steps, the preferred format is: <part-id> <sample keyword> <process/method>, e.g. "RS521a 20nmGrid agarose analysis".
	* The template headings for exp parts is currently in the format "Part 1 sample kw + process" to encourage this naming convention.
* Note: This is reversed order from previously where I preferred "RS522 PAINT of 20nmGrid" and "RS521a Agarose analysis of 20nmGrid" (i.e. with <method> before <sample kw>). However, I've found that the <sample identifier> is more descriptive than the method.


Markdown quick reference:

* Links: [Link text](url)
* Inserting images: ![alt text](path/to/image.png "Logo Title Text 1") - "alt text" should describe the image; "title text" should provide additional information.
* Reference style: ![alt text][summary_image]
	* then later: [summary_image]: path/to/image.png
* Resizing images: Not generally supported. Either resize the image file, or use HTML: <img src="drawing.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 200px;"/>
