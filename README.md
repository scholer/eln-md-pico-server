# Zepto ELN server

Zepto ELN server: Flat-file Markdown-based wiki-style electronic laboratory notebook and journal.

Pico-inspired web app for serving Markdown documents as HTML-compiled web pages, written in Python.


Basic web server app for serving Markdown documents as HTML-compiled web pages, written in Python.
Inspired by Pico CMS. 

For local and online journal presentation.



This is a Python equivalent to my NextPicoELN nextcloud app (TODO: Rename to NextZeptoELN),
which you can run locally without setting up a nextcloud server and install the NextPicoELN app.
